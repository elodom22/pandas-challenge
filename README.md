Summary:
A total of 15 disctict and charter schools were analyzed to assess the overall reading and math metrics for students of each individial school. 
The total population of each school in relation to school budget expenditures were compared to assess educational succes between charter and district schools.

1. Charter schools have significantly higher reading and match scores and % passing in comparision to disctrict schools

2. Charter have significantly less total students then district schools and spend less dollars per student in comparison to distrcit schools.
