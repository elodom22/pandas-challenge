# pandas-challenge
This challenge focuses on analyzing school and standardized test data using Pandas in Jupyter Notebook. As the Chief Data Scientist for a school district, participants will process student math and reading scores alongside school-specific data to identify performance trends. The task involves creating DataFrames to summarize district-wide metrics, school-specific statistics, and performance breakdowns based on spending, size, and type. The goal is to provide insights that help guide future budget and policy decisions while reinforcing Python data analysis skills.

## Conclusion:

1. Charter schools have significantly higher reading and match scores and % passing in comparision to disctrict schools

2. Charter have significantly less total students then district schools and spend less dollars per student in comparison to distrcit schools.
